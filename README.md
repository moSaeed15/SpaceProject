## My process

Built some utility classes to help me with the styling of the HTML file, primarily using a CSS grid for the main layout and flex for smaller components. Also implemented some simple hover animations and an interactive hamburger menu. Built with mobile first approach then tablet and desktop as to make it responsive on all viewports. As for the JavaScript, had a render function for each page that renders the content for whatever subpage clicked. in so, only 4 HTML files were needed for 12 different pages/subpages. Also implemented some aria attributes and a keyboard navigation between pages to increaseÂ accessibility.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
